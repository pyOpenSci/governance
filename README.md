## What is pyOpenSci?

pyOpenSci is devoted to building diverse, supportive community around
the Python open source tools that drive open science. We do this through:

* open peer review
* mentorship and
* training.

pyOpenSci is an independent organization, fiscally sponsored by Community
Initiatives.

We draw inspiration from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), a
community to help promote, teach, and grow best-practices in software development
for the Scientific `R` stack.

## Contributing statement


## How to setup

This repository contains the source files for the [pyOpenSci governance](https://pyopensci.org/governance).

## Build the governance document locally

Our governance documentation is built with [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org) which is a documentation tool.

The easiest way to build our documentationis to use [the `nox` automation tool](https://nox.thea.codes/), a tool for quickly building environments and running commands within them.
Using `nox` ensures that your environment has all the dependencies needed to build the documentation.

To build, follow these steps:

1. Install `nox`

   ```console
   $ pip install nox
   ```
2. Build the documentation:

   ```console
   $ nox -s docs
   ```

This should create a local environment in a `.nox` folder, build the documentation (as specified in the `noxfile.py` configuration), and the output will be in `_build/html`.

To build live documentation that updates when you update local files, run the following command:

```console
$ nox -s docs-live
```
