# Organization intro

pyOpenSci is an non-profit organization whose mission is to build diverse,
supportive community around the free and open Python tools that drive open
science.

pyOpenSci supports open science through

* **Open Peer review:** pyOpenSci runs an open peer review process lead by volunteer editors and reviewers. This process has several goals including reducing functionality overlap in existing open source tools; supporting long term maintenance of tools and/or carefully sunsetting of tools as needed and increasing the quality of tools built to support scientific workflows.
* **Mentorship:** We will build out a community program where diverse community members are mentored in skills needed to both contribute to open source software which in turn will propel their open science skills forward.
* **Training:** pyOpenSci will provide training in skills needed to contribute to open source software.
