# Review process: Python Packaging Guidebook

pyOpenSci maintainers a [Python packaging guidebook](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/) that  provides
recommendations and best practices for creating and sharing Python code.
Open source software and shared code are critical pieces of open science and of making science more collaborative.

While pyOpenSci seeks to support the broader scientific community, it is
important that our content is also accessible and beginner-friendly. Accessible content allows more people to participate in science and is core to our goals of creating diverse community that is empowered in the open science ecosystem.

pyOpenSci has a review process that ensures all of it's online content is:

* accurate
* accessible and
* beginner-friendly.

This page overviews that process.

## Scope
This governance applies to all technical content created for the Python Packaging Guidebook and associated tutorials.

## Roles and Responsibilities

There are several "types" of contributors that are critical to achieving the guidebook's above-stated goals.

- **Content Authors**: Write early drafts with research to ensure accuracy. Engage with content experts for initial reviews.
- **Content Experts**: Provide early feedback on drafts to ensure technical accuracy. This feedback may be in person, or online via direct message / group chats. This feedback is critical to ensuring the initial drafts capture important topics and concepts.
- **Community Reviewers**: Participate in the GitHub pull request review process,
  providing feedback within the designated review period.
- **Moderators**: Oversee the review process, manage conflicts, and ensure that the
  final content meets user needs and standards of accessibility.
- **Decision-Makers**: Facilitate consensus and make final decisions on content approval. Typically the Executive Director of pyOpenSci makes final decisions when consensus can't be made. But more often the community is able to achieve consensus.

## Review Process

### Early Draft Creation
- **Research and Writing**: Authors conduct thorough research and write early drafts.
  Initial drafts should aim for technical accuracy and clarity.
- **Early Expert Review**: Drafts are reviewed by content experts for accuracy and
  technical soundness. Feedback is incorporated to refine the content.

### GitHub Pull Request and Community Review
- **Pull Request Submission**: A polished version of the draft is submitted as a pull
  request on GitHub.
- **Review Timeline**: The community review period is set for 1-2 weeks. Reviewers are
  encouraged to provide feedback on clarity, accuracy, and accessibility.
- **Feedback Collection**: All review comments are documented and addressed by the
  authors.

### Second Review Round (If Necessary)
- **Revision**: If feedback is extensive, authors revise the document based on reviewer
  comments.
- **Second Review**: A second round of community review is held for an additional 1-2
  weeks.

### Finalization and Merging
- **Consensus Building**: Moderators facilitate discussions to reach general consensus
  among reviewers.
- **Conflict Resolution**: If disagreements arise, moderators mediate to resolve
  conflicts, ensuring the content meets user needs.
- **Content Merging**: Once consensus is achieved, the content is merged into the
  guidebook.

## 4. Conflict of Interest Policy
- **Disclosure**: All participants in the review process must disclose any potential
  conflicts of interest, including promotion of tools they work on, authored, or
  maintain.
- **Management**: Conflicts of interest are managed to maintain the integrity and
  fairness of the review process.

## 5. Documentation and Transparency
- **Record Keeping**: All reviews, feedback, and revisions are documented and archived.
- **Transparency**: Information about the review process and decisions is made available
  to the community.

## 6. Appeals Process
- **Grounds for Appeal**: Appeals can be made based on procedural errors or overlooked
  critical feedback.
- **Appeal Procedure**: Appeals must be submitted in writing within two weeks of the
  decision. The appeal will be reviewed by a separate panel of reviewers.

## 7. Review and Revision of Governance
- **Periodic Review**: The governance document is reviewed annually to ensure it remains
  effective and relevant.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: A system for collecting feedback on the review process from
  participants is established to continuously improve the process.

## Conclusion
This governance document ensures a structured, transparent, and fair review process for
the Python Packaging Guidebook, emphasizing accuracy, accessibility, and user-centered
content development. By following these guidelines, we aim to produce high-quality,
beginner-friendly, and technically accurate documentation that serves the needs of our
users.
