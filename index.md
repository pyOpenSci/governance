## Why pyOpenSci?
pyOpenSci promotes open and reproducible research through peer-review of 
scientific Python packages. We also build technical capacity by providing a 
curated repository of high-quality packages and enabling scientists to write 
and share their own software. We hope to foster a greater sense of community 
among scientific Python users so that we can help each other become better 
programmers and researchers.
